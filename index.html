          <h3><strong>Personal Profile</strong></h3>
          <p>I am a confident, inquisitive python developer with strong analytical and numerical skills.
            My experience using Python and Oracle SQL have led to a keen interest in test driven development and its application to help a business make efficient, maintainable solutions.
            I have previously used R and Excel for a variety of statistical analysis within a financial setting.
            Working towards being a full stack developer, I am flexible, picking up new technical skills quickly and I am eager to develop my skills further.
            My career to date has helped me become a good communicator and to work well as part of a team and on my own initiative also.</p></td>
